    <h1> 311 Calls are the Canaries in the Sewer Coalmines</h1>
        <h3> Due to climate change, frequent flooding in NYC is here to stay. NYC residents who call 311 for sewer backups in their homes can help DEP target the city's 7,500 miles of sewer lines </h3>

        <p>
        James Carney, 62, said that trying to prevent sewer backups in his Bay Ridge, Brooklyn home was like "money going down the drain." </p>

        <p> Carney was one of 20 neighbors who gathered at the Community Board 10 meeting in October to speak with the Brooklyn Borough Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, Drisana Hughes, about raw sewage flooding their homes during heavy rains.</p>
 

        <p> Hughes said that the number of 311 sewer backup calls from Bay Ridge was not enough to trigger a sewer drainage study, a necessary investigation prior to any capital sewer project.</p>

<p>Hughes emphasized the importance of 311 calls to decision makers at the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p>"I see the power that 311 has internally. I've seen how impactful that data is on my side," Hughes said. </p>

<p>When New York City residents lodge complaints about sewer backups in their homes to the city's 311 service, the Department of Environmental Protection will confirm whether the backup is due to grease, debris or heavy rain. </p>

<p>An analysis of 311 sewer backup calls due to heavy rain from 2015 to 2025 showed that zip code 11234, which includes Bergen Beach, Mill Basin, Marine Park and parts of Flatlands in southern Brooklyn, had the highest average number of 311 calls with 25 calls. </p>

<p>Zip code 11215, which includes Park Slope and Gowanus in central Brooklyn, had the second highest average number of 311 calls with 19 calls. </p>

<p>The Department of Design and Construction completed a $62 mllion sewer upgrade project in Bergen Beach in 2023. The number of 311 sewer backup calls in zip code 11234 decreased significantly after 2023.</p>

<p> Sue Ann Partnow, district manager of Brooklyn Community Board 18, which includes zip code 11234, wrote in a Dec. 19 e-mail, "We have not had any recent complaints about sewer backups in Bergen Beach, especially after the last snow and today's heavy rain." </p>

<p>Similarly, the Department of Design and Construction completed a $54 million sewer upgrade project in Gowanus in 2023. The number of 311 sewer backup calls in zip code 11215 decreased significantly after 2023. </p>

<p> In contrast, the rate of sewer backup calls in Bay Ridge, zip code 11209, remains elevated after 2023. There are currrently no capital sewer projects planned for Bay Ridge, according to Douglas Auer, spokesperson for the Department of Environmental Protection. </p>

<iframe title="Rate of change of 311 sewer backup calls in zip code 11209 since 2014" aria-label="Line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-bZh1V" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bZh1V/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="510" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>


<p> Hughes said that despite the paucity of 311 calls, she initiated a sewer drainage study in Bay Ridge in October. She said a drainage study usually takes one year to complete, and a new sewer project will likely not start until late 2030s.</p>

<p> In the meantime, Hughes recommended that residents protect their homes by installing one-way backwater valves in their main sewer lines, placing sump pumps and flood sensors in the basements and rerouting gutter downspouts to keep rainwater out of the sewer system.
